    /* ---------------- SOURCE OF TRUTH for "right now" ----------------

       Open-Meteo answers with two different "now"s and they legitimately disagree.
       `current` is INTERPOLATED TO THE MINUTE the request was made; `hourly[i]` is the
       value AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR. Both are correct, they are simply not the same
       measurement — which is why the Now card read 91° beside a NOW chip reading 90° on
       the wall, and why the rollover refetch above (a real fix, for a real second cause)
       could never finish the job. Refetching cannot make two different quantities equal.

       THE DECISION: hourly[nowIndex()] is this wall panel's truth.

         * Everything else on the screen already comes out of hourly[]. The 24-chip strip,
           the hourly panel's list and hero, the daily panel's hour bars — 50-odd numbers.
           Sourcing the ONE big number from `current` made one number disagree with all
           the rest; sourcing it from hourly[] makes the whole wall one payload, one hour,
           one reading.
         * `current` moves between fetches while hourly[] does not, so a card fed from it
           can drift away from the strip at ANY moment, not only across a rollover. There
           is no cadence that fixes that; there is only picking one array.
         * The cost is honest and small: the big number is the hour's value rather than
           this minute's, on a panel read from 2-4 m that also shows the next 24 hours.

       Fields hourly[] does not carry (pressure, gusts) still come from `current` — they
       have nothing on screen to disagree with. `current` is also the whole fallback when
       there is no usable hourly slot. */
