     "78 deg" read as "about half full of something" — and thirty pixels above it the same
     eight hours were already drawn as a warm-to-cool curve. Two grammars for one variable
     on one screen, and the bar was the one that could not be right: temperature has no
     zero to fill from. The figure carries the curve's own colour instead, which makes the
     list a legend for the chart rather than a competitor to it.

     Three buckets, not an interpolation: the app has exactly three temperature tokens and a
