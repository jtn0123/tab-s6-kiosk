         Rebuilt, because the old version was the worst-reading element in the app:

           * It labelled a TIME axis with TEMPERATURES, one every three bars. Two adjacent
             ticks both read 90° while the bar between them was visibly taller than either
             — the labels were describing the bars they sat above, but they were positioned
             like axis ticks, so they read as a scale that contradicted the chart.
           * It had no time axis at all. There was markup for one, but the chart sat flush
             against the panel footer and the hour row was clipped away underneath it.
           * The bars were a solid accent fill covering ~6% of the screen — 54x the home
             view, and the largest bright area in an app whose own stylesheet says to avoid
             large bright fills on an OLED panel.

         Now: the axis along the bottom is TIME, every three hours, and it is the only
         repeating label. Temperature appears exactly twice, on the warmest and coldest
         bars, where a number is an annotation of that bar rather than a scale. The fill is
         dim with a bright cap (see .daybar-c in style.css), so the shape still reads from
         across a room at a fraction of the lit area. */
