/* Wall panel dashboard — SETTINGS.

   Real, persisted, applied immediately. One idiom per concept: a segmented control only
   for a genuine either/or between two named values, a switch row for everything that is
   merely on or off.

   One widget, one flat file (assets/ cannot hold subdirectories — aapt2 on Windows writes
   the separator as a backslash and file:///android_asset/ cannot resolve it). The plugin
   contract is unchanged and is documented in wx-ui.js.
