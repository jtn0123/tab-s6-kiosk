/* Wall panel dashboard — CLOCK.

   The wall clock on the home card, and a detail panel with the calendar arithmetic
   and nine world clocks — all computed with Intl, no network and no key.

   One widget, one flat file (assets/ cannot hold subdirectories — aapt2 on Windows writes
   the separator as a backslash and file:///android_asset/ cannot resolve it). The plugin
   contract is unchanged and is documented in wx-ui.js.
