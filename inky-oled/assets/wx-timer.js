/* Wall panel dashboard — STOPWATCH & TIMER.

   Timekeeping is done from Date.now() deltas rather than by counting ticks, so it stays

       written up as a fix for something it does not fix. Every ring still logs 4-5 of
       "AS.AudioService: Uncaught exception" from system_server — measured across three
       consecutive alarms, with the audio session id staying constant, so the context really
       is being reused and the exceptions are not tied to session creation. They come from
       Samsung's AudioServiceDumpProvider dumping AudioService on this ROM and throwing
       inside system_server while doing it; it is not this app's exception, nothing in the
       app's own logcat stream reports an error, and the chirp plays.

       What reuse is actually worth: one context rather than one per alarm (no unbounded
       accumulation of hardware clients over a wall panel's uptime), and an app run that
       never rings never opens audio at all. Keep it for those reasons.
