/* Wall panel dashboard — SKY MODEL (the half of the sky layer with no canvas in it).

   Given the clock and the sunrise/sunset the API actually reported: what colour is the
   light right now? And, given a WMO code and a cloud percentage: what weather is it?

   This exists as its own file for two reasons. The obvious one is the 500-line budget —
   wx-sky.js could not carry both the painters and this. The better one is that everything
   here is PURE, which means the part of the layer that decides what the panel feels like
   at 6am is testable without a canvas, and is tested at every phase boundary
   (test/sky-light.test.js). The painters can only be looked at; the model can be pinned.

   WHY THE PAYLOAD AND NOT A CLOCK GUESS: the layer used to key off the WMO code alone,
   with a day/night flag, so half past four in December and half past four in June painted
   the same panel. The Open-Meteo payload has carried daily.sunrise / daily.sunset from the
   first request this app ever made; nothing was reading them. A wall panel that knows when
   the sun came up is the difference between a readout and a window.

   THE ALPHA BUDGET, which is the whole discipline: this runs 24/7 on an AMOLED panel where
   a black pixel is an off pixel, and the text on top of it must never have to fight it.
   Every alpha below is part of one budget — the vertical wash tops out at 0.08 and the
   horizon bloom at 0.17, and those two are the only pair that can land on the same pixel
   (at dawn and at dusk the bloom sits low, where the wash is strongest). 0.08 + 0.17 is
   the 0.25 ceiling exactly, with the arithmetic written down rather than hoped for, and
   the real composite measured off the canvas comes in under it because the wash is only
   at ~0.6 of its peak at the height the bloom sits. Colours are near-saturated and the
   ALPHA does the dimming — a pre-dimmed colour at a high alpha would wash the black out,
   cost real power, and light up pixels that ought to be off.

  /* The six moods a day walks through, and every number the painters need to draw one.

       sky/wash    a vertical gradient, transparent at the top of the frame and `wash` at
                   the bottom — light pools at the horizon, which is where the sky is
                   bright at every hour except noon.
       glow/glowA  the sun or the moon: one soft radial bloom, no disc. A disc would be a
                   sticker; a bloom is weather.
       glowX/glowY where that bloom sits, 0..1 of the frame. These interpolate, so over a
                   day the light rises in the east (0.17), passes overhead at noon (0.50,
                   high), and sets in the west (0.86) — the arc is real, and it is also
                   why nothing on this layer ever sits on the same pixels twice.
       stars       0..1 visibility multiplier. Not a hard on/off: stars fade out through
                   dawn and back in through dusk, which is what they do.

     Read as a palette: indigo before dawn, a warm bloom on the horizon at dawn, a neutral
     and almost invisible wash at midday, a long amber through golden hour, violet at dusk,
     cold blue at night. Nothing here is a hue you would call digital. */
