/* Poll and repaint cadences.

   A wall panel runs for months without being touched, so the cost of the idle state is the
   cost of the app. Before this file existed the dashboard, sitting on the resting home view
   with nothing running, did this every single second:

     - rewrote four clock nodes and built a fresh Intl date formatter (86,400/day)
     - rewrote both timer tile nodes at 10 Hz, always with the identical text
     - crossed the JS/Java bridge every 5 s and re-rendered the Device tile (~17,300/day)
     - re-scanned 168 forecast timestamps four times a minute to find the current hour

   and, with the clock panel open, rebuilt its entire body — nine world clocks, eighteen
   freshly-constructed Intl.DateTimeFormat objects — once a second.

   None of that is measurable from a screenshot, which is exactly why it needs tests. Each
   one below states the cadence as a NUMBER, so a regression is a failing count rather than
   something nobody notices until the battery graph tilts. The Device-panel cadence lives in
   device-bridge.test.js with the rest of the bridge contract.

   The counters instrument minidom's textContent / innerHTML accessors. That measures the
   thing that actually costs — a DOM write, i.e. a layout invalidation — rather than a
   proxy for it. */
